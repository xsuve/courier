# Courier - Food Delivery Analytics for Couriers
This was an idea I was thinking about when the food delivery industry boomed (at least in my area/country). I wanted to give the food couriers a platform for themselves. They would connect the food delivery app via the API and the stats would get available in an organized way in the platform - total kilometers, heatmap where you delivered the most, a social network for couriers, etc.
I also wanted to take a look at VueJS integrated with PHP so this was the initial work on Vue.
